#### 1. Introduction

> Here at Opacity Storage Inc., your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy is provided so that we may better explain our privacy practices, and inform you of your choices regarding the way your information is collected and used.

> When you use our Site and/or our Services (“Site/Services”) you are expressly and voluntarily accepting and agreeing to our processing of your information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy.

Nothing in the service is designed to ask for your personal information, track your usage, or access your personal files. By using the OPQ token, payment services are anonymous. Only you have access to the file handles as described in Opacity’s Terms and Conditions.

> Supplying information to us, including any information deemed sensitive by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part.
